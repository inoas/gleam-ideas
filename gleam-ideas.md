# Gleam Ideas

This is a document of ideas for the Gleam language that where to awkward or rejected for other reasons.

These ideas may be great or utterly bad.

* Extended number types
  * Enforce size limits (if result is equal to maximum size, Result is Error)
  * Allow / Disallow 0
  * Enforce sign (always negative, always positive)
  * Only functions to do math operations
  * Conversion to basic Gleam types: from_float/from_int and to_float/to_int (all return Results)
* List builder which can always be used for optimal performance and abstracts away list prepend/reverse
